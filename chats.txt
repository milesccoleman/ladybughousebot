What is Ladybug House?
Ladybug House will be Seattle's first home for children, adolescents and young adults, offering rest and rejuvenation to families (respite), and if needed, an option for end-of-life support in the community. Ladybug House is a non-profit, 501(c)(3).   Daily care that would otherwise be provided at the child’s home will be provided at Ladybug House, we will offer a home-like environment that differs from the hospital environment.  
What does Ladybug House do?
The vision of Ladybug House is to build a home that will support children, adolescents, and young adults with life-limiting illnesses, and their families. Our goal is to open a freestanding, independent home-like facility with 12 family suites where families can receive support and a place to rest and have a break from being the caregivers 24/7 and if needed an option for end-of-life care outside of the hospital in a home environment. Families will be welcomed to stay at Ladybug House together or they may have time away while their child spends time alone receiving loving professional care. This allows families the opportunity to concentrate on being parents, siblings, grandparents, etc. while the Ladybug House staff attends to the daily needs of the child. Ladybug House will meet the needs of the families as they define them. Physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual needs will be addressed.

Not yet. We are looking for a donation of three to five acres from the city, businesses or a private donation. Members of our Land Committee are working to find a suitable building site for Ladybug House.
When will Ladybug House be open to accept families?
Hopefully soon. For now, concurrent with our efforts to raise funds for building the facility, we have established a community outreach program that we call “Ladybug Love,” offering support and resources to families in need of short-term respite care and providing them with some quality of life and memory making opportunities. We have also partnered with the Leukemia and Lymphoma society to bring a much needed speaker series to the community. “Conversations that Matter” will be hosted quarterly, open to the community, medical and professional services.

We have made great strides. We've garnered over 1.3  million dollars in in-kind professional support work, we have an office (thanks to HainLine Construction) in downtown Seattle, and we are moving to make legislative changes with regard to pediatric palliative care. It is our goal to find land in 2020 and break ground once $12 million of the overall capital campaign goal of $20 million is raised. We intend to raise the money needed prior to building, knowing that we will have ongoing fundraising needs once the home is built.

The home will be available to support families who are caring for their children with life limiting illnesses giving them a place for rest and time to be together and if needed an option for end of life support outside of the hospital.

How old do you have to be to go to Ladybug House?
During the initial phase we will be looking at 19 years of age and under, but will look at young adults on a need to need basis. Seattle Children's Hospital treats to age 29. This will further be decided with the support of the community.
How much does it cost?
It is our goal to offer respite and end-of-life care to children and families at no out of pocket cost. This is because we do not want to turn families away and know that many families who have a child with a life-limiting condition have often exhausted all of their financial resources and have tapped into their long-term savings to look after their child. This model differs from the adult residential hospice model.
